    "Traffic fatalities are a significant issue in the United States. The goal of this project proposal is to use data science to identify factors contributing to traffic accidents and develop targeted interventions to reduce the number of fatalities using resources from 2016-2021.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), the number of traffic fatalities in the United States from 2016 to 2021 is as follows:\n",
    "* 2016: 37,806 \n",
    "* 2017: 37,133 \n",
    "* 2018: 36,835 \n",
    "* 2019: 36,096 \n",
    "* 2020: 38,680 \n",
    "* 2021: 42,915 \n",
    "\n",
    "It's worth noting that 2020 saw an increase in traffic fatalities, despite a decrease in the number of vehicles on the road due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The reasons for this increase are complex and multifactorial, but some contributing factors include an increase in risky behaviors such as speeding and distracted driving, as well as an increase in alcohol and drug use."

These APIs broadcast traffic data captured by a variety of entities, such as the US and state departments of transportation, law enforcement agencies, traffic cameras, and traffic sensors within the road-networks. Currently, there are about 2.8 million accident records in this dataset. Check here to learn more about this dataset.\n",

The data is collected from January 2016 to December 2021, using historical weather reports that were collected from 2,071 airport-based weather stations across the nation.\n",
