    "Traffic fatalities are a significant issue in the United States. The goal of this project proposal is to use data science to identify factors contributing to traffic accidents and develop targeted interventions to reduce the number of fatalities using resources from 2016-2021.\n",

    "According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), the number of traffic fatalities in the United States from 2016 to 2021 is as follows:\n",

The reasons for this increase are complex and multifactorial, but some contributing factors include an increase in risky behaviors such as speeding and distracted driving, as well as an increase in alcohol and drug use."

    "The US Accidents (2016-2021) dataset available on Kaggle is a rich source of information about traffic accidents that occurred in the United States over a period of five years. This dataset is compiled from various sources, including traffic cameras, police reports, and other public data sources. The dataset contains information about more than 2.8 million traffic accidents, including the location, time, and date of the accident, as well as information about the severity of the accident, the number of people involved, and the weather conditions at the time of the accident.\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset can be used for a variety of purposes, such as identifying the most dangerous roads and intersections, predicting accident rates based on weather conditions or time of day, and evaluating the effectiveness of traffic safety measures. By conducting EDA on this dataset, we can gain valuable insights into the factors that contribute to traffic accidents and develop strategies to reduce the number of accidents and improve road safety.\n",
    "\n",
    "`weather` this is a countrywide weather events dataset that includes 7.5 million events, and covers 49 states of the United States. Examples of weather events are rain, snow, storm, and freezing condition. Some of the events in this dataset are extreme events (e.g. storm) and some could be regarded as regular events (e.g. rain and snow). The data is collected from January 2016 to December 2021, using historical weather reports that were collected from 2,071 airport-based weather stations across the nation.\n",
    "\n",
    "`constructions` this is a countrywide dataset of road construction and closure events, which covers 49 states of the US. Construction events in this dataset could be any roadwork, ranging from fixing pavements to substantial projects that could take months to finish. The data is collected from Jan 2016 to Dec 2021"
