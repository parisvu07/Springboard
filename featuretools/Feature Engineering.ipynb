    "\n",
    "__Problem:__ we have a set of cutoff times and labels - in a label times table - and we need to build relevant features for each label using only data from before the cutoff time. Traditionally, we would do this by hand, a painstaking and error prone process that makes developing useable machine learning solutions extremely difficult. \n",
    "\n",
    "__Solution__: Use automated feature engineering as implemented in Featuretools to build hundreds or thousands of relevant features from a relational dataset with a reusable framework that also automatically filters the data based on the cutoff times. This approachs overcomes the limitations of manual feature engineering, letting us buidl better predictive models in a fraction of the time. \n",
    "\n",
    "The general process of feature engineering is shown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./images/feature_engineering_process.png)\n",

    "\n",
    "![](./images/featuretools-logo.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll work with Featuretools to develop an automated feature engineering workflow for the customer churn dataset. The end outcome is a function that takes in a dataset and label times for customers and builds a feature matrix that can be used to train a machine learning model. Because we already partitioned the data into independent subsets (in `Partitioning Data`) we'll be able to apply this function to all of the partitions in parallel using Spark with PySpark.\n",

    "\n",
    "Automated feature engineering is a significant improvement over manual feature engineering in terms of both time and modeling performance. In this notebook, we implemented an automated feature engineering workflow with Featuretools for the customer churn problem. Given customer data and label times, we can now calculate a feature matrix with several hundred relevant features for predicting customer churn while ensuring that our features are made with valid data for each cutoff time. \n",
    "\n",
    "Along the way, we implemented a number of Featuretools concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. An entityset and entities\n",
    "2. Relationships between entities\n",
    "3. Cutoff times\n",
    "4. Feature primitives\n",
    "5. Custom primitives\n",
    "6. Deep feature synthesis\n",
    "\n",
    "These concepts will serve us well in future machine learning projects that we can tackle with automated feature engineering.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "Although we often hear that \"data is the fuel of machine learning\", data is not exactly a fuel but more like crude oil. _Features_ are the refined product that we feed into a machine learning model to make accurate predictions. After performing prediction engineering and automated feature engineering, the next step is to use these features in a predictive model to estimate the _label_ using the _features_. \n",
    "\n",
    "Generating hundreds of features automatically is impressive, but if those features cannot allow a model to learn our prediction problem then they are not mcuch help! The next step is to use our features and labeled historical examples to train a machine learning model to make predictions of customer churn. We'll make sure to test our model using a hold-out testing set to estimate performance on new data. Then, after validating our model, we can use it on new examples by passing the data through the feature engineering process. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to see how to parallelize feature engineering in Spark, see the `Feature Engineering on Spark` notebook. Otherwise, the next notebook is `Modeling`, where we develop a machine learning model to predict churn using the historical labeled examples and the automatically engineered features."
